# Posys-improved-cursors-linux

My own variant of Posy's improved cursors adapted to linux.

It includes cursors from:

- The original set by Michiel de Boer (a.k.a Posy): <http://www.michieldb.nl/other/cursors/>
- <https://code.garrettmills.dev/garrettmills/archive-posy-cursors>
- <https://github.com/simtrami/posy-improved-cursor-linux>
- <https://github.com/vinceliuice/McMojave-cursors>
  - Specifically the "pirate", "x-cursor" and "wayland-cursor"

Some of the cursors have been edited to change the colour pallete and size.
