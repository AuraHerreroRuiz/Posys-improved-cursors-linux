# Posys-improved-cursors-linux

My own variant of Posy's improved cursors adapted to linux.

It includes cursors from:

- [The original set by Michiel de Boer (a.k.a Posy)](http://www.michieldb.nl/other/cursors/): licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)
- Modifications of those cursors by <https://code.garrettmills.dev/garrettmills/archive-posy-cursors> and <https://github.com/simtrami/posy-improved-cursor-linux>
- The Specifically the "pirate", "x-cursor" and "wayland-cursor" by <https://github.com/vinceliuice/McMojave-cursors> under [GPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

Some of the cursors have been edited to change the colour pallete and size.
